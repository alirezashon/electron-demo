# mobin-net-desktop-demo
desktop output (Electron Forge).

This project is just a prototype to present to the customer and its front end is written with raw HTML,
if you are looking to develop a desktop application, you can go to the document https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest .

After you clone the project with the command (npm run make), you can output it on any operating system you have and run it on your personal system.
I had little time to make this sample and did not reach an agreement with the customer to make it completely.

If you intend to use Electron, I recommend you to use JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as React and Node js for front-end and back-end development,
and use WebPack for better project management.
