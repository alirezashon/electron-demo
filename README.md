PC App (Electron Forge).


if you are looking to develop a desktop application, you can go to the document https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest .

After you clone the project with the command (npm run make), you can output it on any operating system you have and run it on your personal system.

If you intend to use Electron, I recommend you to use JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as React and Node js for front-end and

back-end development,

and use WebPack for better project management.
